# BeeClustAnalyst
Matlab scripts for plots and statistics

In BeeClust the behaviour of a swarm is analysed on statistical grounds. Hundreds of bees are simulated in an aggregation scenario. These scripts analyse the bees' postion and density over the course of the simulation.

The initial datasets were generated in BeeGround, which is a separate simulator, then exported to firther process in MatLab.
